If you're already familiar with the Pok√©mon GO mapping scene, it shouldn't take too much for you to get Exeggcute up and running.

In fact there's just few pre-requirements that are required on your end before getting started:
- [Dragonite]
- [Rotom]
- [One or more configured devices]
- [A valid API key to use Exeggcute]

[Dragonite]: https://github.com/UnownHash/Dragonite-Public
[Rotom]: https://github.com/UnownHash/Rotom
[One or more configured devices]: {% link docs/installation/device-setup/device-setup.md %}
[A valid API key to use Exeggcute]: {% link docs/installation/mapping-tiers.md %}
