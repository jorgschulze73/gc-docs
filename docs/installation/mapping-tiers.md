Exeggcute follows a graduated tier pricing system, so prices change depending on the amount of mapping workers associated with your subscription.

{: .note }
> Every subscription allows you to run Exeggcute on any of the supported platforms: iOS, macOS, Android (physical and virtual)

For a precise breakdown you can consult your Stripe dashboard, however for convenience here's short table elaborating on the most popular tiers available:
